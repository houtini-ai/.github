## What We're Building

AI tools are powerful but they're also overwhelming. Documentation written by robots for robots. Enterprise solutions when you just need to get Tuesday's work done.

We build the bridges. MCP servers that connect your tools. Research-backed analysis that improves your content. Practical AI SEO stuff that works.

No hype. No £997 courses. Just tools that help you work smarter.

## Our Tools

### 🔍 **[Fan-Out MCP](https://github.com/houtini-ai/fanout-mcp)**
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@houtini/fanout-mcp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@houtini/fanout-mcp)
[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/houtini-ai/fanout-mcp/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/houtini-ai/fanout-mcp)
[![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/@houtini/fanout-mcp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@houtini/fanout-mcp)
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/houtini-ai/fanout-mcp?style=social)](https://github.com/houtini-ai/fanout-mcp)

Advanced content gap analysis using Query Decomposition and Keyword Fan-Out (Google's patented methodology). Tells you exactly what user queries your content covers - and what it misses. Built on academic research because I needed to understand how AI search engines actually evaluate content.

Works with Self-RAG validation, so no hallucinations. Every coverage claim includes exact quotes from your content.

```bash
npx @houtini/fanout-mcp@latest
```

### 🌍 **[GEO Analyzer](https://github.com/houtini-ai/geo-analyzer)**
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@houtini/geo-analyzer)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@houtini/geo-analyzer)
[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/houtini-ai/geo-analyzer/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/houtini-ai/geo-analyzer)
[![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/@houtini/geo-analyzer)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@houtini/geo-analyzer)
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/houtini-ai/geo-analyzer?style=social)](https://github.com/houtini-ai/geo-analyzer)

SEO is dead. Long live GEO (Generative Engine Optimisation). This tool shows you exactly how AI search engines see your content - claim density, writing quality, E-E-A-T signals, extractability. Research-backed metrics that correlate with 40% higher AI citation rates.

Built it because traditional SEO metrics stopped predicting what gets cited by ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini. Turns out AI search engines care about different signals.

```bash
npx @houtini/geo-analyzer@latest
```

### 🚀 **[Gemini MCP](https://github.com/houtini-ai/gemini-mcp)**
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@houtini/gemini-mcp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@houtini/gemini-mcp)
[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/houtini-ai/gemini-mcp/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/houtini-ai/gemini-mcp)
[![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/@houtini/gemini-mcp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@houtini/gemini-mcp)
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/houtini-ai/gemini-mcp?style=social)](https://github.com/houtini-ai/gemini-mcp)

Connect Claude to Google's Gemini with search grounding, deep research, and video analysis. Why? Because sometimes you need a second opinion. Or real-time information Claude doesn't have. Or you want to analyse YouTube videos for accessibility descriptions.

Works with Gemini 3.0 Pro - the fast, capable model that won't burn your API budget.

```bash
npx @houtini/gemini-mcp@latest
```

### 🔎 **[Google Knowledge Graph MCP](https://github.com/houtini-ai/google-knowledge-graph-mcp)**
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@houtini/google-knowledge-graph-mcp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@houtini/google-knowledge-graph-mcp)
[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/houtini-ai/google-knowledge-graph-mcp/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/houtini-ai/google-knowledge-graph-mcp)
[![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/@houtini/google-knowledge-graph-mcp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@houtini/google-knowledge-graph-mcp)
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/houtini-ai/google-knowledge-graph-mcp?style=social)](https://github.com/houtini-ai/google-knowledge-graph-mcp)

Search Google's public Knowledge Graph for structured entity information. Get facts about people, places, organisations, and concepts from Google's database - the same data that powers those info boxes on search results.

Built it because I needed quick access to verified entity data without web scraping. Uses Google's free public API (not the Enterprise version), so no billing account required.

```bash
npx @houtini/google-knowledge-graph-mcp@latest
```

### 🎙️ **[Voice Analyser](https://github.com/houtini-ai/voice-analyser-mcp)**
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@houtini/voice-analyser)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@houtini/voice-analyser)
[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/houtini-ai/voice-analyser-mcp/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/houtini-ai/voice-analyser-mcp)
[![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/@houtini/voice-analyser)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@houtini/voice-analyser)
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/houtini-ai/voice-analyser-mcp?style=social)](https://github.com/houtini-ai/voice-analyser-mcp)

Extract your writing voice from published articles and generate immersive style guides. Traditional style guides list rules - this tool extracts the statistical fingerprint of how you actually write. Sentence rhythm, vocabulary patterns, argument flow, the micro-rhythms that make writing feel human.

Feed it your sitemap, get back a guide that teaches LLMs to replicate your voice through examples, not rules. Experimental but effective.

```bash
npx @houtini/voice-analyser@latest
```

## Quick Start

Pick your flavour:

```bash
# Fan-Out content analysis (keyword variants + gap analysis)
npx @houtini/fanout-mcp@latest

# GEO analysis (AI search optimisation)
npx @houtini/geo-analyzer@latest

# Gemini integration (search grounding + research)
npx @houtini/gemini-mcp@latest

# Google Knowledge Graph (entity information)
npx @houtini/google-knowledge-graph-mcp@latest

# Voice analysis (writing style extraction)
npx @houtini/voice-analyser@latest

```

Then configure in Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fanout": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@houtini/fanout-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. You're running.

## Who This Is For

- **Content marketers** trying to optimise for AI search engines
- **SEO practitioners** who know traditional metrics aren't enough anymore
- **Web workers** managing multiple tools and workflows
- **Freelancers** who can't justify another monthly subscription
- **Anyone** tired of context window limits and API rate limits

We're not building for enterprise. We're building for Tuesday morning when you need to ship something and the usual tools aren't cutting it.

## The Real Story

I'm Richard. Twenty years on the web, two years deep in AI. Started building these tools because I needed them. Turns out other people need them too.

Every tool here addresses a problem I've hit.

## Philosophy

AI shouldn't be complicated. It shouldn't require a PhD or a massive budget. It should just help you work better. It's certainly no replacement for creativity but as a productivity tool it's awesome.

Every tool we build follows these rules:
1. It solves a real problem
2. It works
3. It doesn't require a manual to understand

That's it. No manifestos. No disruption. Just tools that work.
